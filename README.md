**TFHE-rs** is a pure Rust implementation of TFHE for boolean and integer
arithmetics over encrypted data. It includes:
 - a **Rust** API
 - a **C** API
 - and a **client-side WASM** API

**TFHE-rs** is meant for developers and researchers who want full control over
what they can do with TFHE, while not having to worry about the low level
implementation. The goal is to have a stable, simple, high-performance, and
production-ready library for all the advanced features of TFHE.

## Getting Started

To use the latest version of `TFHE-rs` in your project, you first need to add it as a dependency in your `Cargo.toml`:

+ For x86_64-based machines running Unix-like OSes:

```toml
tfhe = { version = "*", features = ["boolean", "shortint", "integer", "x86_64-unix"] }
```

+ For Apple Silicon or aarch64-based machines running Unix-like OSes:

```toml
tfhe = { version = "*", features = ["boolean", "shortint", "integer", "aarch64-unix"] }
```
Note: users with ARM devices must use `TFHE-rs` by compiling using the `nightly` toolchain.


+ For x86_64-based machines with the [`rdseed instruction`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RDRAND) 
running Windows:

```toml
tfhe = { version = "*", features = ["boolean", "shortint", "integer", "x86_64"] }
```

Note: aarch64-based machines are not yet supported for Windows as it's currently missing an entropy source to be able to seed the [CSPRNGs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographically_secure_pseudorandom_number_generator) used in TFHE-rs

Note that when running code that uses `tfhe-rs`, it is highly recommended
to run in release mode with cargo's `--release` flag to have the best performances possible,
eg: `cargo run --release`.

Here is a full example evaluating a Boolean circuit:

```rust
use tfhe::boolean::prelude::*;

fn main() {
    // We generate a set of client/server keys, using the default parameters:
    let (client_key, server_key) = gen_keys();

    // We use the client secret key to encrypt two messages:
    let ct_1 = client_key.encrypt(true);
    let ct_2 = client_key.encrypt(false);

    // We use the server public key to execute a boolean circuit:
    // if ((NOT ct_2) NAND (ct_1 AND ct_2)) then (NOT ct_2) else (ct_1 AND ct_2)
    let ct_3 = server_key.not(&ct_2);
    let ct_4 = server_key.and(&ct_1, &ct_2);
    let ct_5 = server_key.nand(&ct_3, &ct_4);
    let ct_6 = server_key.mux(&ct_5, &ct_3, &ct_4);

    // We use the client key to decrypt the output of the circuit:
    let output = client_key.decrypt(&ct_6);
    assert_eq!(output, true);
}
```

Another example of how the library can be used with shortints:

```rust
use tfhe::shortint::prelude::*;

fn main() {
    // Generate a set of client/server keys
    // with 2 bits of message and 2 bits of carry
    let (client_key, server_key) = gen_keys(PARAM_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2);

    let msg1 = 3;
    let msg2 = 2;

    // Encrypt two messages using the (private) client key:
    let ct_1 = client_key.encrypt(msg1);
    let ct_2 = client_key.encrypt(msg2);

    // Homomorphically compute an addition
    let ct_add = server_key.unchecked_add(&ct_1, &ct_2);

    // Define the Hamming weight function
    // f: x -> sum of the bits of x
    let f = |x:u64| x.count_ones() as u64;

    // Generate the accumulator for the function
    let acc = server_key.generate_accumulator(f);

    // Compute the function over the ciphertext using the PBS
    let ct_res = server_key.apply_lookup_table(&ct_add, &acc);

    // Decrypt the ciphertext using the (private) client key
    let output = client_key.decrypt(&ct_res);
    assert_eq!(output, f(msg1 + msg2));
}
```

An example using integer:

```rust
use tfhe::integer::gen_keys_radix;
use tfhe::shortint::parameters::PARAM_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2;

fn main() {
    // We create keys to create 16 bits integers
    // using 8 blocks of 2 bits
    let (cks, sks) = gen_keys_radix(&PARAM_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2, 8);

    let clear_a = 2382u16;
    let clear_b = 29374u16;

    let mut a = cks.encrypt(clear_a as u64);
    let mut b = cks.encrypt(clear_b as u64);

    let encrypted_max = sks.smart_max_parallelized(&mut a, &mut b);
    let decrypted_max: u64 = cks.decrypt(&encrypted_max);

    assert_eq!(decrypted_max as u16, clear_a.max(clear_b))
}
```

## Disclaimers

### Security Estimation

Security estimations are done using the
[Lattice Estimator](https://github.com/malb/lattice-estimator)
with `red_cost_model = reduction.RC.BDGL16`.

When a new update is published in the Lattice Estimator, we update parameters accordingly.

### Side-Channel Attacks

Mitigation for side channel attacks have not yet been implemented in TFHE-rs,
and will be released in upcoming versions.
