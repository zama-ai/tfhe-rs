**TFHE-rs** is a pure Rust implementation of TFHE for boolean and small integer
arithmetics over encrypted data. It includes:
 - a **Rust** API
 - a **C** API
 - and a **client-side WASM** API

**TFHE-rs** is meant for developers and researchers who want full control over
what they can do with TFHE, while not having to worry about the low level
implementation. The goal is to have a stable, simple, high-performance, and
production-ready library for all the advanced features of TFHE.

## Getting Started

To use the latest version of `TFHE-rs` in your project, you first need to add it as a dependency in your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
tfhe = { version = "*", features = [ "boolean","shortint","x86_64-unix" ] }
```

Here is a full example evaluating a Boolean circuit:

```rust
use tfhe::boolean::prelude::*;

fn main() {
// We generate a set of client/server keys, using the default parameters:
    let (mut client_key, mut server_key) = gen_keys();

// We use the client secret key to encrypt two messages:
    let ct_1 = client_key.encrypt(true);
    let ct_2 = client_key.encrypt(false);

// We use the server public key to execute a boolean circuit:
// if ((NOT ct_2) NAND (ct_1 AND ct_2)) then (NOT ct_2) else (ct_1 AND ct_2)
    let ct_3 = server_key.not(&ct_2);
    let ct_4 = server_key.and(&ct_1, &ct_2);
    let ct_5 = server_key.nand(&ct_3, &ct_4);
    let ct_6 = server_key.mux(&ct_5, &ct_3, &ct_4);

// We use the client key to decrypt the output of the circuit:
    let output = client_key.decrypt(&ct_6);
    assert_eq!(output, true);
}
```

Another example of how the library can be used with shortints:

```rust
use tfhe::shortint::prelude::*;

fn main() {
    // We generate a set of client/server keys, using the default parameters:
    let (client_key, server_key) = gen_keys(Parameters::default());

    let msg1 = 1;
    let msg2 = 0;

    let modulus = client_key.parameters.message_modulus.0;

    // We use the client key to encrypt two messages:
    let ct_1 = client_key.encrypt(msg1);
    let ct_2 = client_key.encrypt(msg2);

    // We use the server public key to execute an integer circuit:
    let ct_3 = server_key.unchecked_add(&ct_1, &ct_2);

    // We use the client key to decrypt the output of the circuit:
    let output = client_key.decrypt(&ct_3);
    assert_eq!(output, (msg1 + msg2) % modulus as u64);
}
```

## Disclaimers

### Security Estimation

Security estimations are done using the
[Lattice Estimator](https://github.com/malb/lattice-estimator)
with `red_cost_model = reduction.RC.BDGL16`.

When a new update is published in the Lattice Estimator, we update parameters accordingly.

### Side-Channel Attacks

Mitigation for side channel attacks have not yet been implemented in TFHE-rs,
and will be released in upcoming versions.
