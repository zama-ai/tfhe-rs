**TFHE-rs** is a pure Rust implementation of TFHE for boolean and integer
arithmetics over encrypted data. It includes:
 - a **Rust** API
 - a **C** API
 - and a **client-side WASM** API

**TFHE-rs** is meant for developers and researchers who want full control over
what they can do with TFHE, while not having to worry about the low level
implementation. The goal is to have a stable, simple, high-performance, and
production-ready library for all the advanced features of TFHE.

## Getting Started
The steps to run a first example are described below. 

### Cargo.toml configuration
To use the latest version of `TFHE-rs` in your project, you first need to add it as a dependency in your `Cargo.toml`:

+ For x86_64-based machines running Unix-like OSes:

```toml
tfhe = { version = "*", features = ["boolean", "shortint", "integer", "x86_64-unix"] }
```

+ For Apple Silicon or aarch64-based machines running Unix-like OSes:

```toml
tfhe = { version = "*", features = ["boolean", "shortint", "integer", "aarch64-unix"] }
```
Note: users with ARM devices must use `TFHE-rs` by compiling using the `nightly` toolchain.


+ For x86_64-based machines with the [`rdseed instruction`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RDRAND) 
running Windows:

```toml
tfhe = { version = "*", features = ["boolean", "shortint", "integer", "x86_64"] }
```

Note: aarch64-based machines are not yet supported for Windows as it's currently missing an entropy source to be able to seed the [CSPRNGs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographically_secure_pseudorandom_number_generator) used in TFHE-rs


## A simple example

Here is a full example:

``` rust
use tfhe::prelude::*;
use tfhe::{generate_keys, set_server_key, ConfigBuilder, FheUint32, FheUint8};

fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    // Basic configuration to use homomorphic integers
    let config = ConfigBuilder::all_disabled()
        .enable_default_integers()
        .build();

    // Key generation
    let (client_key, server_keys) = generate_keys(config);

    let clear_a = 1344u32;
    let clear_b = 5u32;
    let clear_c = 7u8;

    // Encrypting the input data using the (private) client_key
    // FheUint32: Encrypted equivalent to u32
    let mut encrypted_a = FheUint32::try_encrypt(clear_a, &client_key)?;
    let encrypted_b = FheUint32::try_encrypt(clear_b, &client_key)?;

    // FheUint8: Encrypted equivalent to u8
    let encrypted_c = FheUint8::try_encrypt(clear_c, &client_key)?;

    // On the server side:
    set_server_key(server_keys);

    // Clear equivalent computations: 1344 * 8 = 10752
    let encrypted_res_mul = &encrypted_a * &encrypted_b;

    // Clear equivalent computations: 1344 >> 8 = 42
    encrypted_a = &encrypted_res_mul >> &encrypted_b;

    // Clear equivalent computations: let casted_a = a as u8;
    let casted_a: FheUint8 = encrypted_a.cast_into();

    // Clear equivalent computations: min(42, 7) = 7
    let encrypted_res_min = &casted_a.min(&encrypted_c);

    // Operation between clear and encrypted data:
    // Clear equivalent computations: 7 & 1 = 1
    let encrypted_res = encrypted_res_min & 1_u8;

    // Decrypting on the client side:
    let clear_res: u8 = encrypted_res.decrypt(&client_key);
    assert_eq!(clear_res, 1_u8);

    Ok(())
}
```

To run this code, use the following command: 
<p align="center"> <code> cargo run --release </code> </p>

Note that when running code that uses `tfhe-rs`, it is highly recommended
to run in release mode with cargo's `--release` flag to have the best performances possible,

## Disclaimers

### Security Estimation

Security estimations are done using the
[Lattice Estimator](https://github.com/malb/lattice-estimator)
with `red_cost_model = reduction.RC.BDGL16`.

When a new update is published in the Lattice Estimator, we update parameters accordingly.

### Side-Channel Attacks

Mitigation for side channel attacks have not yet been implemented in TFHE-rs,
and will be released in upcoming versions.
