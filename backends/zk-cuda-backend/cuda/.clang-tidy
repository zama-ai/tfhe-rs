# Clang-Tidy configuration for zk-cuda-backend
#
# This configuration suppresses warnings about uninitialized record types
# for Fp and Fp2, which are POD types that must remain POD-compatible
# for CUDA __constant__ memory usage.

Checks: '-*,cppcoreguidelines-pro-type-member-init'

CheckOptions:
  # Ignore arrays in member initialization checks
  # This suppresses warnings for Fp and Fp2 which contain array members
  # that are intentionally uninitialized and immediately assigned via
  # helper functions (e.g., fp_sub_raw, fp_zero, etc.)
