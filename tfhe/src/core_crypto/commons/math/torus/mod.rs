//! Converting to torus values.
//!
//! The theory behind some of the homomorphic operators of the library, uses the real torus
//! $\mathbb{T} = \mathbb{R} / \mathbb{Z}$, or the set or real numbers modulo 1 (elements of the
//! torus are in $[0,1)$). In practice, floating-point number are not well suited to performing
//! operations on the torus, and we prefer to use unsigned integer values to represent them.
//! Indeed, unsigned integer can be used to encode the decimal part of the torus element with a
//! fixed precision.
//!
//! Still, in some cases, we may need to represent an unsigned integer as a torus value in
//! floating point representation. For this reason we provide the [`IntoTorus`] and [`FromTorus`]
//! traits which allow to go back and forth between an unsigned integer representation and a
//! floating point representation.
