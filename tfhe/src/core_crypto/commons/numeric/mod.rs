//! Generic numeric traits.
//!
//! This module contains types and traits to manipulate numeric types in a generic manner. For
//! instance, in the standard library, the `f32` and `f64` trait share a lot of methods of the
//! same name and same semantics. Still, it is not possible to use them generically. This module
//! provides the [`FloatingPoint`] trait, implemented by both of those type, to remedy the
//! situation.
//!
//! # Note
//!
//! The current implementation of those traits does not strive to be general, in the sense that
//! not all the common methods of the same kind of types are exposed. Only were included the ones
//! that are used in the rest of the library.
