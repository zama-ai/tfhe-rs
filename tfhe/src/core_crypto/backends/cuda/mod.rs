//! A module containing the cuda backend implementation.
//!
//! This module contains CUDA GPU implementations of some FHE cryptographic primitives. In
//! particular, it makes it possible to execute bootstraps on a vector of ciphertext vectors, with a
//! vector of LUT and a bootstrap key as other inputs. To do so, the backend also exposes functions
//! to transfer data to and from the GPU, via conversion functions.
