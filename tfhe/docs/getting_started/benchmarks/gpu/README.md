# Benchmarks over GPU

This document details the GPU performance benchmarks of homomorphic operations using **TFHE-rs**.

By their nature, homomorphic operations run slower than their cleartext equivalents.

{% hint style="info" %}
All GPU benchmarks were launched on H100 GPUs, and rely on the multithreaded PBS algorithm.
