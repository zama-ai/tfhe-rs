# Benchmarks

This document summarizes the timings of some homomorphic operations over 64-bit encrypted integers, depending on the hardware. More details are given for [the CPU](cpu\_benchmarks.md), [the GPU](gpu\_benchmarks.md), or [zeros-knowledge proofs](zk\_proof\_benchmarks.md).

You can get the parameters used for benchmarks by cloning the repository and checking out the commit you want to use (starting with the v0.10.0 release) and run the following make command:

```console
make print_doc_bench_parameters
```
