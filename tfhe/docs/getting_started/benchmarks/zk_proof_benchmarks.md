# Zero-knowledge proof benchmarks

This document details the performance benchmarks of [zero-knowledge proofs](../../fhe-computation/advanced-features/zk-pok.md) for [compact public key encryption](../../fhe-computation/advanced-features/public_key.md) using **TFHE-rs**.

Benchmarks for the zero-knowledge proofs have been run on a `m6i.4xlarge` with 16 cores to simulate an usual client configuration. The verification are done on a `hpc7a.96xlarge` AWS instances to mimic a powerful server.
