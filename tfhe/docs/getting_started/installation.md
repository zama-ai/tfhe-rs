# Installation

## Importing into your project

To use `TFHE.rs` in your project, you first need to add it as a dependency in your `Cargo.toml`:


```toml
tfhe = { version = "0.1.0", features = [ "booleans","shortints","x86_64-unix" ] }
```

## Choosing your features

`TFHE.rs` exposes different `cargo features` to customize the types and features used.

### Kinds.

This crate exposes two kinds of data types. Each kind is enabled by activating its corresponding 
feature in the TOML line. Each kind may have multiple types:

| Kind      | Features     | Type(s)                                  |
| --------- | ------------- |------------------------------------------|
| Booleans  | `booleans`    | Booleans                                 |
| ShortInts | `shortints`   | Small unsigned integers                  |


### Serialization.
The different data types and keys exposed by the crate can be serialized / deserialized.

More information can be found [here](../Booleans/serialization.md) for Booleans and 
[here](../shortint/serialization.md) for shortint.

## Supported platforms
TFHE.rs supports Linux (x86, aarch64), macOS (x86, aarch64), Windows (x86 with `RDSEED` 
instruction). 

| OS        | x86              | aarch64          |
| --------- | -------------    |------------------|
| Linux     | `x86_64-unix`    | `aarch64-unix`*  |
| macOS     | `x86_64-unix`    | `aarch64-unix`*  |
| Windows   | `x86_64`         | Unsupported      |

{% hint style="info" %}
Users who have ARM devices can use `TFHE.rs` by compiling using the
`nightly` toolchain.

First, install the needed Rust toolchain:

```shell
rustup toolchain install nightly
```

Then, you can either:

* Manually specify the toolchain to use in each of the cargo commands:

For example:

```shell
cargo +nightly build
cargo +nightly test
```

* Or override the toolchain to use for the current project:

```shell
rustup override set nightly
# cargo will use the `nightly` toolchain.
cargo build
```

To check the toolchain that Cargo will use by default, you can use the following command:

```shell
rustup show
```
