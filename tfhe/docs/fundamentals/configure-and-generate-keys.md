# Configure and create keys

The first step is the creation of the configuration. The configuration is used to declare which type you will (or will not) use, as well as enabling you to use custom crypto-parameters for these types. Custom parameters should only be used for more advanced usage and/or testing.

A configuration can be created by using the ConfigBuilder type.

In this example, 8-bit unsigned integers with default parameters are used. The `integers` feature must also be enabled, as per the table on [this page](broken-reference).

The config is generated by first creating a builder with all types deactivated. Then, the integer types with default parameters are activated, since we are going to use FheUint8 values.

```rust
use tfhe::{ConfigBuilder, generate_keys};

fn main() {
    let config = ConfigBuilder::default().build();


    let (client_key, server_key) = generate_keys(config);
}
```

The `generate_keys` command returns a client key and a server key.

The `client_key` is meant to stay private and not leave the client, whereas the `server_key` can be made public and sent to a server for it to enable FHE computations.
