# GPU acceleration

This guide explains how to update your existing program to leverage GPU acceleration, or to start a new program using GPU.

**TFHE-rs** now supports a GPU backend with CUDA implementation, enabling integer arithmetic operations on encrypted data.

## Prerequisites

* Cuda version >= 10
* Compute Capability >= 3.0
* [gcc](https://gcc.gnu.org/) >= 8.0 - check this [page](https://gist.github.com/ax3l/9489132) for more details about nvcc/gcc compatible versions
* [cmake](https://cmake.org/) >= 3.24
* Rust version - check this [page](rust\_configuration.md)

## Importing to your project

To use the **TFHE-rs** GPU backend in your project, add the following dependency in your `Cargo.toml`.

If you are using an `x86` machine:

```toml
tfhe = { version = "0.8.0", features = [ "boolean", "shortint", "integer", "x86_64-unix", "gpu" ] }
```

If you are using an `ARM` machine:

```toml
tfhe = { version = "0.8.0", features = [ "boolean", "shortint", "integer", "aarch64-unix", "gpu" ] }
```

For optimal performance when using **TFHE-rs**, run your code in release mode with the `--release` flag.

### Supported platforms

**TFHE-rs** GPU backend is supported on Linux (x86, aarch64).

| OS      | x86           | aarch64          |
| ------- | ------------- | ---------------- |
| Linux   | `x86_64-unix` | `aarch64-unix`\* |
| macOS   | Unsupported   | Unsupported\*    |
| Windows | Unsupported   | Unsupported      |

## A first example

### Configuring and creating keys.

Comparing to the [CPU example](../getting\_started/quick\_start.md), GPU set up differs in the key creation, as detailed [here](run\_on\_gpu.md#Setting-the-keys)

Here is a full example (combining the client and server parts):

```rust
use tfhe::{ConfigBuilder, set_server_key, FheUint8, ClientKey, CompressedServerKey};
use tfhe::prelude::*;

fn main() {

    let config = ConfigBuilder::default().build();

    let client_key= ClientKey::generate(config);
    let compressed_server_key = CompressedServerKey::new(&client_key);

    let gpu_key = compressed_server_key.decompress_to_gpu();

    let clear_a = 27u8;
    let clear_b = 128u8;

    let a = FheUint8::encrypt(clear_a, &client_key);
    let b = FheUint8::encrypt(clear_b, &client_key);

    //Server-side

    set_server_key(gpu_key);
    let result = a + b;

    //Client-side
    let decrypted_result: u8 = result.decrypt(&client_key);

    let clear_result = clear_a + clear_b;

    assert_eq!(decrypted_result, clear_result);
}
```

Beware that when the GPU feature is activated, when calling: `let config = ConfigBuilder::default().build();`,
the cryptographic parameters differ from the CPU ones, used when the GPU feature is not activated.
Indeed, TFHE-rs uses dedicated parameters for the GPU in order to achieve better performance.

### Setting the keys

The configuration of the key is different from the CPU. More precisely, if both client and server keys are still generated by the client (which is assumed to run on a CPU), the server key has then to be decompressed by the server to be converted into the right format. To do so, the server should run this function: `decompressed_to_gpu()`.

Once decompressed, the operations between CPU and GPU are identical.

### Encryption

On the client-side, the method to encrypt the data is exactly the same than the CPU one, as shown in the following example:

```Rust
    let clear_a = 27u8;
    let clear_b = 128u8;
    
    let a = FheUint8::encrypt(clear_a, &client_key);
    let b = FheUint8::encrypt(clear_b, &client_key);
```

### Computation

The server first need to set up its keys with `set_server_key(gpu_key)`.

Then, homomorphic computations are performed using the same approach as the [CPU operations](../getting\_started/operations.md).

```Rust
    //Server-side
    set_server_key(gpu_key);
    let result = a + b;

    //Client-side
    let decrypted_result: u8 = result.decrypt(&client_key);

    let clear_result = clear_a + clear_b;

    assert_eq!(decrypted_result, clear_result);
```

### Decryption

Finally, the client decrypts the results using:

```Rust
    let decrypted_result: u8 = result.decrypt(&client_key);
```

## List of available operations

The GPU backend includes the following operations for both signed and unsigned encrypted integers:

## Multi-GPU support

TFHE-rs supports platforms with multiple GPUs with some restrictions at the moment:
the platform should have NVLink support, and only GPUs that have peer access to GPU 0 via NVLink
will be used for the computation. 
Depending on the platform, this can restrict the number of GPUs used to perform the computation.

There is **nothing to change in the code to execute on multiple GPUs**, when 
they are available and have peer access to GPU 0 via NVLink. To keep the API as user-friendly as possible, the configuration is automatically set, i.e., the user has no fine-grained control over the number of GPUs to be used.

## Benchmark 
Please refer to the [GPU benchmarks](../getting_started/benchmarks/gpu_benchmarks.md) for detailed performance benchmark results.

## Warning
When measuring GPU times on your own on Linux, set the environment variable `CUDA_MODULE_LOADING=EAGER` to avoid CUDA API overheads during the first kernel execution.
