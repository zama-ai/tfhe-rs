# Specifying a path without code owners means that path won't have owners and is akin to a negation
# i.e. the `core_crypto` dir is owned and needs owner approval/review, but not the `gpu` sub dir
# See https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-code-owners#example-of-a-codeowners-file
